Based on lists of input data, preprocessing methods and discriminant methods, the following code selects the best combinations using the functions from the three lists. e.g. a discriminant method (Decision tree) + preprocessing methods (SVN + detrend) + input data (referenced data matrix + 1st derivative).

The project in the paper aims to predict the sweetness of navel oranges by analyzing the data obtained using near infrared (NIR) spectroscopy. Due to the application of machine learning algorithms in data analysis, the project requires a balance between prediction accuracy and training cost. This balance was innovatively approached by combining two categories of machine learning, supervised learning and reinforcement learning. To achieve this combination, a new concept of model visualization was introduced. As a result, the model was proven been helpful to improve the prediction accuracy. 

Due to the poor data collection at the beginning of the research, the overall accuracy is relatively low. However, the improving pattern showing in most charts proved the reliability of the model optimization process. Meanwhile, we used a better database from another research project in the model and the prediction became much more accurate. This fact comfirmed that the low accuracy was caused by the poor data collection.

The paper about the model construction is publishing soon. To see more details, please keep following the update of this file. The access information will be attached later.
